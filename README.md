<h1>Spring Boot Employee Management Project With Oracle Database</h1>

<p>In This Project I Have <b>Spring Boot</b> At Back End And <b>React.js</b> At Front End</p>

<p>All The Requests Go To One End Point ==> <b>/api/v1/employees</b></p>

<p><b>GET</b> Requests To This End Point Will Retrieve All The Employees</p>

<p><b>GET</b> Requests To This End Point With <b>Id</b> As Path Variable Will Retrieve An Employee With The Given Id</p>

<p><b>POST</b> Requests To This End Point Will Add An Employee To The Database</p>

<p><b>PUT</b> Requests To This End Point With Id As Path Variable Will Update An Employee With The Given Id</p>

<p><b>DELETE</b> Requests To This End Point With Id As Path Variable Will Delete An Employee With The Given Id</p>

<p>For Database I've Used <b>Oracle</b></p>

<p>For Working With Database I've Used <b>Spring Data JPA</b></p>

<p>Front End Code Is From => <a href="https://github.com/RameshMF/ReactJS-Spring-Boot-CRUD-Full-Stack-App/tree/master/react-frontend">This Source</a></p>
